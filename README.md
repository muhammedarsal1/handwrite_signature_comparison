 # Handwriting & Signature Verification


This project aims to provide handwriting and signature verification using deep learning techniques. It leverages a Siamese Network for signature verification and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwriting 
classification. The project includes a Streamlit interface for users to interact with the models.


## Features
Signature Verification: Compare two signature images to verify if they belong to the same person using a Siamese network.

### Handwriting Classification: 
Classify handwriting samples into various styles using a CNN model.

### Streamlit Web Interface: 
A simple and intuitive web interface to test the models with image uploads.

### Clone the repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

### Install dependencies:

Install required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

### Run the Streamlit App:

Launch the Streamlit web app for testing the models and verifying signatures or handwriting.

## Models

Siamese Network: A specialized neural network used to compare two signature images and determine if they match.

CNN for Handwriting: A Convolutional Neural Network to classify different handwriting styles.
