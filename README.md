Handwriting & Signature Verification
This project aims to provide handwriting and signature verification using deep learning techniques. It leverages a Siamese Network for signature verification and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for handwriting classification. The project includes a Streamlit interface for users to interact with the models.

Features
Signature Verification: Compare two signature images to verify if they belong to the same person using a Siamese network.

Handwriting Classification: Classify handwriting samples into various styles using a CNN model.

Streamlit Web Interface: A simple and intuitive web interface to test the models with image uploads.
